> *"To be built to love is to be built to dissolve. It is to be built to unbecome. It is to have the sole purpose of falling apart all in the name of someone else."*

Even the grandest of stories can feel small and immediate when it's just one person's life.

One of the most well-known names from one of the most well-known clades on the System, the avatar of political machinations and cool confidence, has been brought low. With help coming only from Ioan Bălan and the most grudging of support from her cocladists, all True Name has left to save herself is the ability to change.

### Advance Praise

>  It’s no surprise that this series was a favorite of mine, what with the LGBTQ+ cast, furries, and the use of programming concepts in its world building. If you’re into sci-fi or just love a good fleshed out world I would recommend giving the books a try.
