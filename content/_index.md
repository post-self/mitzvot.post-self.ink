> *"To be built to love is to be built to dissolve. It is to be built to unbecome. It is to have the sole purpose of falling apart all in the name of someone else."*

Even the grandest of stories can feel small and immediate when it's just one person's life.

One of the most well-known names from one of the most well-known clades on the System, the avatar of political machinations and cool confidence, has been brought low. With help coming only from Ioan Bălan and the most grudging of support from her cocladists, all True Name has left to save herself is the ability to change.

## The *Mitzvot* Kickstarter

*Mitzvot* is being funded as a Kickstarter to help with the costs of cover art and publication. The book is already written and publication is definite, but this will allow me to do all sorts of neat things through stretch goals:


* **$750** ✨ Backed! ✨ — An extended appendix chock full of information about the world and the people in it.
* **$1,000** ✨ Backed! ✨ — "Selected Letters", an extended epilogue to Mitzvot and thus the Post-Self cycle as a whole, perhaps an additional 20,000 words added to the book.
* **$1,250** ✨ Backed! ✨ — As with the previous books, there is a piece of writing that is mentioned in Mitzvot; in books 2 and 3, those works are excerpted on the part pages. This stretch goal is for adding those!
* **$1,500** ✨ Backed! ✨ — Hardcover editions of all four books. Should this goal be reached, these will be available as an add-on either in addition to or as an upgrade from paperbacks.
* **$1,750**  ✨ Backed! ✨— Two interior illustrations for the book, also by Iris Jay!
* **$2,000**  ✨ Backed! ✨ — A special edition box set of the four volume series in a slip-case. Should this goal be reached, the slip-case will be available as an add-on to all tiers, in case you already backed the hardcovers.
* **$2250** — Commissioned interior art for all four books (may cause slight delay in production of the hardcovers)
* **$2500** — Post-Self TTRPG setting (I have notes for both Fate and d20!)
* **$3000** — Paid anthology of short stories commissioned from authors interested in the setting.
