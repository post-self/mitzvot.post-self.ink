### *Mitzvot* Launch Party

Come and join for a small book launch event on Saturday, January 21 at noon Pacific! There will be readings, some chat about the Post-Self series, and sales on all of the books. The whole thing will take place online and may be watched on Twitch.tv, where I will stream from VR. It'll take place in Beat Saber, which is probably a world first. You can watch at <https://twitch.tv/ephahvix>.

> *"To be built to love is to be built to dissolve. It is to be built to unbecome. It is to have the sole purpose of falling apart all in the name of someone else."*

Even the grandest of stories can feel small and immediate when it's just one person's life.

One of the most well-known names from one of the most well-known clades on the System, the avatar of political machinations and cool confidence, has been brought low. With help coming only from Ioan Bălan and the most grudging of support from her cocladists, all True Name has left to save herself is the ability to change.

### Advance Praise

>  Mitzvot drills down deeper into the lives of its characters and shows us that between the world-shattering projects that change the very understanding of the System, they’re just people trying to live their lives with love and purpose.
