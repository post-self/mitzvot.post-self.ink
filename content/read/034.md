# Part IV --- Reconciliation

> *The Living know that they will die*  
> *but the dead know nothing.*
>
> By our very act of knowing, of remembering, of denying our own deaths, the dead are left in limbo, for every idea's opposite is the absence of that idea, and we can no longer grant them even that absence.

From *Ode* by Sasha
